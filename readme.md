# [CSSandbox v0.0.7](http://www.thepixelsandbox.com)
Simple yet powerfull responsive mobile first framework


## History
Why make yet another responsive framework?<br>
Because the market is needing one: Lightweight sass framework, but not too light!


## Install
Fell free to download it from here.


## How to use it
Please note that there is no documentation at the time writing this.<br>
You can always read the code to get started.


## Browser support
* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Mozilla Firefox 20+
* Internet Explorer 9+
* Opera 12+

Why not IE8? Our framework will show, but some major features like media queries isn't supported<br>
Please note that jQuery 2.0 (Used as javascript framework) does not support IE8 either.

For more information about IE8 market share (Currently ~5%) see w3schools
