# [CSSandbox v0.0.6](http://www.thepixelsandbox.com)
Simple yet powerfull responsive mobile first framework


## History
Why make yet another responsive framework?<br>
Because the market is needing one: Lightweight sass framework, but not too light!


## Install
Fell free to download it from here.


## How to use it
Please note that there is no documentation at the time writing this.<br>
You can always read the code to get started.


## Browser support
* Google Chrome
* Apple Safari
* Mozilla Firefox 20+
* Internet Explorer 9+
* Opera 12+

Why not IE8? Our framework should work with IE8, but it's not supported!


## Developer Tools
* [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [Phoenix theme](https://github.com/netatoo/phoenix-theme)
* GitHub
* Ruby with compass
* Jekyll for the docs
